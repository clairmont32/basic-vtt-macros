mend:
  custom_name: Gnomeite
  description: "Mend â€” a sticky sap-like substance that uses the regenerative properties similar to that of a wood woad. A single hair of the item's owner is required to ensure the bond between creature and the repaired item remains strong. The paste requires 1d3+1 hours to solidify on its own, however, fluids from the owner or an Artificer can act as a bonding agent thus reducing the curing time to 1 hour. The fluid must cover the entire paste to be effective."

longstrider:
  custom_name: Beans of Acceleration
  description: "Semi-rare horse pill like bean that's bitter and breaks into chunks. Grows half way up on a mountainside. A single plant grows 3 beans and is not typically seen in groups of 3."
